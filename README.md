Project 2 - ITM 362

myIIT Rehab - For this project, we will redesign the myIIT login page, welcome page, and one more aspect of the site (TBD) to reflect what we learned in HCI.

Group Members:

Akvile - I believe that my strengths are in creating semantic HTML and CSS to make for a strong website. I still want to practice JavaScript more and learn to utilize more of that in my sites.

Aury - I'd like to believe that JavaScript is my forte. I am also pretty confident about my capacity to build strong semantic HTML.
